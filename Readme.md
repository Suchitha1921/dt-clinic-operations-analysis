# DeepThought CultureTech – Role Test Drive Assignment

This repository contains my analysis and system design solutions for the
Role Test Drive Assignment shared by DeepThought CultureTech.

The objective of this submission is not task completion, but demonstrating
structured thinking, problem analysis, and realistic system design within
busy healthcare clinic environments.

## Structure of the Repository
- `task-1-inventory-audit.md` – Statistical micro-audit design for clinic inventory
- `task-2-patient-communication.md` – Patient care & communication system design
- `voice-note.txt` – Voice note summary reference

## Approach
I approached both tasks by first understanding real-world clinic constraints
(time pressure, manual processes, and doctor cognitive load), and then designing
lightweight, practical systems that improve discipline without adding complexity.

## Fair AI Usage
This submission follows the Fair AI Usage Policy outlined in the assignment.
All reasoning, structure, and explanations are written in my own words, with AI
used only as a thinking aid and not for direct answer generation.
