# DeepThought CultureTech – Role Test Drive Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Role Test Drive Assignment shared
by DeepThought CultureTech.

The purpose of this submission is not task completion, but to demonstrate
structured thinking, clarity of reasoning, and the ability to design practical
systems for real-world clinic environments.

Both tasks are approached from the perspective of a busy healthcare clinic,
where manual processes, time pressure, and doctor cognitive load are key
constraints.

## Repository Structure

- `task-1-inventory-audit.md`  
  Design of lightweight statistical micro-audits to detect inventory errors
  without full reconciliation.

- `task-2-patient-communication.md`  
  A simple patient care and follow-up communication system using HMS data and
  Google Sheets to reduce WhatsApp chaos and protect doctor time.

- `voice-note.txt`  
  Reference note indicating a short voice summary submitted along with this
  assignment.

## Approach

For both tasks, I first focused on understanding how clinics actually function
on the ground—manual data entry, limited staff bandwidth, and doctors operating
under constant cognitive load.

The solutions are intentionally simple, operationally realistic, and designed
to improve discipline and clarity without introducing heavy processes or tools.
